-   [file_column_count.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/file_column_count.m), counts the number of columns in the first line of a file.
-   [file_row_count.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/file_row_count.m), counts the number of row records in a file.
-   [r8mat_data_read.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/r8mat_data_read.m), reads the data from an R8MAT file.
-   [r8vec_data_read.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/r8vec_data_read.m), reads the data from an R8VEC file.
-   [r8vec_header_read.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/r8vec_header_read.m), reads the header from an R8VEC file.
-   [s_len_trim.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/s_len_trim.m), returns the length of a character string to the last nonblank.
-   [shallow_water_1d_display.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/shallow_water_1d_display.m), a program to display each timestep of the solution; the user hits RETURN to advance.
-   [timestamp.m](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/shallow_water_1d_display/timestamp.m)  prints the YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
